# Welcome to my Code Refactor! 

Hi! This is a code refactoring assignment to not only create a public repository and deploy my own website, but also to modify pre-existing coding to remove as many "div" tags as possible, and change them to semantic tags. The reason why, is because semantic tags make someone who is unfamiliar to the code able to understand the code easier. As a developer, the goal is to create code that will be easily accessible and from what I've learned so far, part of being part of the coding community is to leave a code better than how you may have found it!

<strong>The Challenge</strong>

 - I will know the assignment has been completed when the following has been accomplished:
		 
		 - A new, public repository has been created. 
		 - When each section of the code has been removed of the "div" tags and replaced with semantic tags. 
		 - When the selectors in style.css have been replaced. 
		 - When the repository has been deployed!
